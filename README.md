# Example Git Repository

* Learning how to use git professionally.

### **Git Steps**
1. Initialize a git repo using `git init`
2. Make some changes
3. Stage the changes using `git add`
4. Commit the changes using `git commit -m ".."`
5. Push the changes to Github `git push origin` (assuming set up has already occured.) 

* ***Note**: Use the graphical interface, GitLens, when necessary. For example, when viewing the `git diff`. Diffs, commits, and branching can be viewed in the CLI, but are often better in the graphical interface.*
